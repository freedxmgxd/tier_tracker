# Joelton D. Junior's League of Legends Ranking Tracker Bot for Discord

## Description

This bot is a simple bot that tracks the tier ranking of players in League of Legends and assigns them a role in the discord channel based on their tier.

## Usage

To enable the bot, type `!ping` in the channel that the bot has access to. The bot will then respond with a message that says `Pong!`. This means that the bot is online and ready to be used.

To a player be tracked, type `!track <summoner name>`. This means that the bot is now tracking the player's tier and will assign them a role in the discord channel based on their tier, which will be updated every time the player logs in to the discord channel.

To be removed from the tracking list, type `!untrack`. This means that the bot will no longer track the player's tier and will remove the role from the player in the discord channel.

## Roadmap

More features will be added to this bot in the future. (Maybe)
